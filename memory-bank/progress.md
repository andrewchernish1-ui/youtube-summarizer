# Progress: YouTube Video Summarizer

## 1. Current Status

-   **Phase:** Phase 1 - MVP Development.
-   **Overall Progress:** Just started. The project structure is in place, and the Memory Bank is initialized.

## 2. What Works

-   The Next.js project is set up with the App Router.
-   The basic UI component library (shadcn/ui) is available.
-   The plan for development is documented in the Memory Bank.
-   **API Integration:** Successfully replaced RapidAPI with Supadata.ai for transcript fetching.
-   **Testing:** Updated unit tests to work with the new Supadata API.
-   **Backend Logic:** The `/api/summarize` route now uses Supadata.ai with proper error handling.
-   **MCP Server:** Successfully configured Supabase MCP server for enhanced development capabilities with read-only access and project scoping.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Phase 1)

-   **Backend (`/api/summarize/route.ts`):**
    -   [x] Implement request validation (Zod) - Already implemented
    -   [x] Implement YouTube video ID extraction logic - Already implemented
    -   [x] Implement the API call to Supadata.ai to fetch the transcript - **COMPLETED**
    -   [x] Implement the API call to Gemini API to generate the summary - Already implemented
    -   [x] Implement comprehensive error handling - Already implemented
-   **Frontend (`/app/page.tsx`):**
    -   [ ] Build the UI form for URL submission.
    -   [ ] Implement client-side state management for input, loading, summary, and errors.
    -   [ ] Implement the logic to call the internal `/api/summarize` endpoint.
    -   [ ] Implement UI components to display the summary, loading state, and error messages.
-   **Testing (`/tests/api/summarize.test.ts`):**
    -   [x] Write tests for the API route, mocking external services - **UPDATED for Supadata**
    -   [x] Test for successful summarization - **UPDATED**
    -   [x] Test for handling of invalid URLs - Already implemented
    -   [x] Test for handling of errors from external APIs - **UPDATED**
-   **Environment:**
    -   [x] Create `.env.local` and populate it with the necessary API keys (SUPADATA_API_KEY instead of RAPIDAPI_KEY) - **COMPLETED**

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

-   **API Keys:** The actual `GEMINI_API_KEY` is required to test the full summarization functionality. The `SUPADATA_API_KEY` is already configured and tested successfully.
-   **Full Integration Test:** Need to test the complete flow (transcript + summary) with a real Gemini API key.
