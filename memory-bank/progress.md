# Progress: YouTube Video Summarizer

## 1. Current Status

-   **Phase:** Phase 1 - MVP Development.
-   **Overall Progress:** Just started. The project structure is in place, and the Memory Bank is initialized.

## 2. What Works

-   The Next.js project is set up with the App Router.
-   The basic UI component library (shadcn/ui) is available.
-   The plan for development is documented in the Memory Bank.

## 3. What's Left to Build (Phase 1)

-   **Backend (`/api/summarize/route.ts`):**
    -   [ ] Implement request validation (Zod).
    -   [ ] Implement YouTube video ID extraction logic.
    -   [ ] Implement the API call to RapidAPI to fetch the transcript.
    -   [ ] Implement the API call to Gemini API to generate the summary.
    -   [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling.
-   **Frontend (`/app/page.tsx`):**
    -   [ ] Build the UI form for URL submission.
    -   [ ] Implement client-side state management for input, loading, summary, and errors.
    -   [ ] Implement the logic to call the internal `/api/summarize` endpoint.
    -   [ ] Implement UI components to display the summary, loading state, and error messages.
-   **Testing (`/tests/api/summarize.test.ts`):**
    -   [ ] Write tests for the API route, mocking external services.
    -   [ ] Test for successful summarization.
    -   [ ] Test for handling of invalid URLs.
    -   [ ] Test for handling of errors from external APIs.
-   **Environment:**
    -   [ ] Create `.env.local` and populate it with the necessary API keys.

## 4. Known Issues & Blockers

-   **API Keys:** The actual `RAPIDAPI_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` are required to test the end-to-end functionality. The development will proceed with placeholders, but final testing is blocked until the keys are provided.
