# Product Context: YouTube Video Summarizer

## 1. Problem Statement

In an age of information overload, consuming long-form video content on platforms like YouTube can be time-consuming. Students, researchers, and professionals often need to quickly extract key information from videos without spending hours watching them. There is a need for a tool that can distill the essential content of a video into a concise, readable summary.

## 2. Vision &amp; Goal

The vision is to create a fast, reliable, and easy-to-use web service that automates the process of summarizing YouTube videos.

The primary goal of the first phase is to launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that effectively demonstrates the core functionality: accepting a YouTube URL and returning a high-quality summary. This will validate the technical approach and provide a foundation for future enhancements.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Goals

-   **Simplicity:** The user interface should be minimal and intuitive. The user journey should be straightforward: paste a link, click a button, get a summary.
-   **Speed:** The process of generating a summary should be as fast as possible. The user should be kept informed with a clear loading indicator during processing.
-   **Clarity:** The final summary should be well-structured, coherent, and easy to read.
-   **Feedback:** The interface should provide clear feedback, whether it's the final summary, a loading state, or an error message (e.g., "Invalid URL" or "Summary could not be generated").

## 4. User Flow

1.  **Landing Page:** The user arrives at the main page and sees a clean interface with a text input field and a "Summarize" button.
2.  **Input:** The user pastes a full YouTube video URL into the input field.
3.  **Submission:** The user clicks the "Summarize" button.
4.  **Processing:** The button becomes disabled, and a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner or skeleton screen) appears, signaling that the request is being processed.
5.  **Success:** The loading indicator is replaced by a display area showing the generated summary.
6.  **Error:** If an error occurs (e.g., invalid link, transcript unavailable), an informative error message is displayed to the user.
